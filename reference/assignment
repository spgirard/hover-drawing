Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.

    Create the divs using JavaScript. Don’t try making them by hand with copy and pasting in your HTML file!

    It’s best to put your grid squares inside another “container” div (which can go directly in your HTML).

    You need make the divs appear as a grid (versus just one on each line). This is a perfect opportunity to apply what you have learned about flexbox.

Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.

Add a button to the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the existing grid should be removed and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (e.g. 960px wide) so that you’ve got a new sketch pad.

Extra Credit
Transform the behavior of a square when interacting with the mouse by introducing a series of modifications.

Rather than a simple color change from black to white, each interaction should randomize the square’s RGB value entirely.

Additionally, implement a progressive darkening effect where each interaction adds 10% more black or color to the square. The objective is to achieve a completely black square only after ten interactions.

You can choose to do either one or both of these challenges, it’s up to you.
